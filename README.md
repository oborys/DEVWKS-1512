# Welcome to Cisco Live Barcelona!

In this session **Hands-On Kicking the Tires of RESTCONF** we will walk through a series of exercises to introduce the topics of NETCONF and YANG and how the two interact. In order to minimize the number of errors introduced by manually typing commands into the lab-top I've provided the user inputs below.

When you see a box that looks like this:

```
Interesting text here
```
You will copy this text and paste it into the terminal. For those that aren't familiar with Linux here is a brief cheat sheet:

### Copy - CTRL+INSERT

Work with python

```
cd DEVWKS-1512/code
python3 -m venv myenv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Let's get started with the lab:
